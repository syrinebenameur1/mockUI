# KothonTech UI Mockup Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive React-based UI mockup for the **KothonTech** platform. The application is designed to simulate a complete ecosystem for technical recruitment, project delivery, and operations management.

The system is divided into three distinct applications (Modules), each serving a specific user persona and business function.

## 🚀 Module Overview

The application uses a "Shell" layout (`App.jsx`) to switch between three independent sub-applications. All data is shared centrally via `DataContext.jsx`.

### 🟢 1. Green App: Assessment & Matching
**Target Audience:** Talent Acquisition, Recruiters, Candidate Screeners.

This module focuses on evaluating developers and finding the right match for client needs.

*   **Talent Entry:** Form to create and edit new developer profiles.
*   **Available Tests:** Catalog of standardized technical assessments (React, Node.js, etc.) to assign to candidates.
*   **Results & Scores:** Table view of candidate performance, percentile rankings, and status.
*   **Client Request:** A dedicated form for clients to input their requirements (Role, Skills, Budget).
*   **Kothon AI Match:** An advanced "Messenger-style" AI chat interface. Users can describe their needs in natural language, and the AI suggests validated candidates from the pool.
*   **Candidate Pools:** Grouping of talents by domain (e.g., Fintech, AI).
*   **Offers:** Management of job offers sent to candidates.

### 🔴 2. Red App: Operations & Delivery
**Target Audience:** Project Managers, Delivery Leads, Operations.

This module manages the ongoing lifecycle of projects, client communication, and secure access.

*   **Dashboard:** High-level overview of active projects, assigned talent, and budget consumption.
*   **Management:** A detailed dual-view tab for **Clients** and **Talent**.
    *   *Client View:* Contracts, Active Projects, Invoices, Feedback history.
    *   *Talent View:* Seniority, Rate, Active engagement, Onboarding status.
*   **Messages:** Integrated communication hub separating "#Admin Support" channels from direct "Project Chat".
*   **Sprint Board:** A Jira-like Kanban board with Swimlanes (To Do, In Progress, Done) for tracking project tasks.
*   **Time & Inv:** Timesheet management for developers and Invoice status tracking (Paid vs Pending).
*   **Docs:** Repository for project specifications and contracts.
*   **Accesses:** A "Secure Vault" UI for managing sensitive credentials (AWS keys, DB passwords) with visual masking.
*   **Onboarding:** Checklist for new talent integration.

### 🔵 3. Blue App: Admin & Business Intelligence
**Target Audience:** C-Level Execs, Admins, Finance.

This module provides strategic insights, financial oversight, and marketing tools.

*   **Contact Lead:** CRM entry form for new business leads and a feed of web inquiries.
*   **CRM (Clients):** Detailed table of all clients, status (Active, Lead, Churned), and Lifetime Value (LTV).
*   **Book-keeping (Finance):** A financial ledger showing Revenue, Expenses, and Profit/Loss, along with recent transactions and recurring SaaS subscriptions.
*   **Tasks:** Admin to-do list with priority tagging.
*   **Dashboards & KPIs:** Rich visual data visualization including:
    *   *Revenue Growth Chart*
    *   *Revenue Source Pie Chart*
    *   *Key Metrics Cards (YTD Revenue, Active Clients)*
*   **LinkedIn Studio:** A content creation suite with:
    *   *Content AI:* Generator for posts based on topic and vibe.
    *   *Content Calendar:* A visual monthly grid showing scheduled posts and reports.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
*   **`App.jsx`**: The main container. It handles the sidebar navigation and conditionally renders the active Module.
*   **`src/modules/`**: Contains the three main route components:
    *   `Module1_AssessmentsMatching.jsx` (Green)
    *   `Module2_Communication.jsx` (Red)
    *   `Module3_Operations.jsx` (Blue)
*   **`src/shared/DataContext.jsx`**: A React Context provider that holds the "Global State" (mock database). It passes down data like `projects`, `developers`, `invoices`, and `messages` to all modules, simulating a real connected backend.

### Styling
*   **`index.css`**: Contains global CSS variables (colors, fonts, spacing) and utility classes (`.card`, `.btn`, `.badge`, `.table-simple`).
*   **Theme System**: The app implements a rigorous "Light Professional" theme using Slate grays and distinct brand colors (Green/Red/Blue) for each module.

### Icons
*   **Lucide React**: Used for all iconography to ensure a consistent, clean, and professional look.
